# MEG

**MEG (Medical Education Game)** is an adventure game built to `educate the public on diseases and their possible symptoms`.

The player controls a character to collect stars and gain points while encountering "bugs" along the way that infect the character. Each time the character hits a "bug", the character becomes infected, a list of symptoms are shown to the player and to advance in the game the player must correctly guess the disease those symptoms belong to.

Whether or not the player gets it right more information about the correct disease (pulled from wikipedia) is shown.

The hackathon project is clearly geared at providing a **medical educational experience** through gaming.
